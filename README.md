The TreasureGram Project is a simple Django demonstration. In the other folder are instructions and files to hook up a Google Cloud instance and serves as an example of what is needed to host the site using a postgres database. My personal keys and cloud instances are not available to use to host with. Must follow google documentation to set up similar enviornment in a new Google Cloud instance.
